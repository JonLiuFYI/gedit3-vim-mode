Features

* normal mode cursor navigation, deletion
* repeating motions
* `J` and `K` move up and down by 15 lines
* Ctrl-C exits insert mode (copies selection in other modes)
* visual mode: copy and paste with `y` and `p`
* go to line number with `<number>G` or `<number>gg`

Installation

or `C:\Program Files\gedit\lib\gedit\plugins` on Windows. This requires PyGObject.
